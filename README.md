# Pakistan Services Limited: Financial, Economic and Strategic Challenges

# Project Overview

This project is a 4-member group project analysing the financial distress and strategic challenges of Pakistan Services Limited (PSL), Pakistan’s largest luxury hospitality operator under the Pearl Continental (PC) brand. Using FY2018-FY2023 financial data, valuation models and on-ground hotel analysis, the study evaluates PSL’s capital structure, liquidity stress and asset utilisation and proposes data-driven restructuring strategies including REIT monetisation, franchising and asset-light growth.

# Hotels Evaluated (PC Portfolio)

The analysis explicitly evaluated performance, cost structure and strategic fit across 6 Pearl Continental hotels:
- PC Karachi
- PC Lahore
- PC Rawalpindi
- PC Bhurban
- PC Malam Jabba
- PC Muzaffarabad

Together, these hotels represent a significant share of PSL’s 1,618 total rooms and span urban, leisure and resort segments, allowing comparative performance assessment.

# Business Context

PSL’s financial stress intensified post-2020 due to macroeconomic shocks and leverage:
- Total liabilities peaked at PKR 22.9 billion (2022)
- Interest coverage ratio fell below 1.0× in multiple years
- Net profit margins turned negative, reaching -21.35% (2020)
- Current ratio declined to 0.89 (2023), indicating liquidity pressure
- PACRA credit rating downgraded from A+ (2019) to BBB 

# Methodology

## Financial and Ratio Analysis

- Profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency and market ratios
- Trend analysis

### Key metrics observed

- EBITDA margin ranged 11%-25%
- Debt servicing increasingly consumed operating cash flows
- Asset turnover consistently <0.35×, signalling underutilisation

## Valuation and Scenario Modelling

- Excel-based valuation and sensitivity analysis
- Stress-tested debt sustainability under interest-rate shocks
- REIT monetisation and franchising impact scenarios

## Strategic Analysis

- Porter’s Five Forces (industry positioning)
- Peer benchmarking (Serena, Avari, international chains)
- Asset-heavy vs asset-light model comparison

# Key Findings

## Liquidity and Solvency

- Cash-to-current-liabilities ratio fell to 0.02 (2023)
- Interest coverage deteriorated to 0.93× (2023)
- Debt burden constrained reinvestment and maintenance capex

## Asset Utilisation

- Inventory turnover worsened from 18 to 27 days
- Debtors’ days increased to 57 days, tightening cash conversion

## Market Performance

- EPS volatility from PKR 15.24 to PKR -53.62
- Market value per share declined by 50% (2022-2023)

# Strategic Scenarios Evaluated
## 1. REIT-Based Asset Monetisation

- Partial monetisation of mature hotel assets
- Estimated liquidity improvement: 53%
- Corporate tax arbitrage: 15% REIT tax vs 33% corporate tax

## 2. Franchising / Asset-Light Model

- Benchmarking vs Marriott and Hilton (99% franchised)
- Reduced capex, lower leverage, steadier fee income

## 3. Cost Optimisation Initiatives

- Energy efficiency (LEDs, solarisation)
- Import localisation
- F&B revenue intensification

# Recommendations

- Adopt REIT structures for mature PC assets
- Transition selectively to franchising in new markets
- Reduce leverage to restore interest coverage >2.0×
- Rebalance portfolio toward higher-margin experiences and FandB

Each recommendation is supported by financial modelling and scenario analysis.

# Tools and Technologies

- **Excel (Advanced):** Valuation, ratio analysis, scenarios
- **Financial frameworks:** Capital structure, turnaround analysis
- **Strategic tools:** Porter’s Five Forces, peer benchmarking

# Team and Contribution Note

This was a 4-member group project completed. The repository documents the collective financial and strategic analysis undertaken by the group.

# Key Skills Demonstrated

- Financial statement and ratio analysis
- Valuation and restructuring modelling
- Hospitality sector strategy
- Translating financial distress into recovery pathways
- Team-based analytical execution

# Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how rigorous financial analysis, applied across multiple operating assets, can uncover viable restructuring paths for distressed firms. It highlights the strategic value of asset monetisation, capital discipline and data-driven decision-making in corporate turnarounds.
